# MintyDAO Overview

## **Executive Summary**

MINTS tokens will earn from MintyDAO revenues in novel NFT, ENS & DeFi public goods.

MINTS token lockers can acquire these new Minty NFTs & domains at their locked MINTS value.

1. New NFT platform:&#x20;
   1. [Old Problem](https://twitter.com/0xfoobar/status/1563614234390704129): NFT fees circumvention breaks project/holder incentives alignment.
   2. New Solution: [0xfoobar's Proposal](ens-and-nft/nft-royalties.md) **-** MINTS royalties via Harberger Fees.
2. New Minty domain system (competes with ENS in an open ecosystem):
   1. Old Problem: as [Vitalik implied](https://twitter.com/vitalikbuterin/status/1568070721753989120), the old ENS system is un-fixably broken in that it already sold its best domains to squatters, which provide much negative value.
   2. New Solution: [Vitalik's ENS fix-proposal](ens-and-nft/vitaliks-ens-fix-proposal.md).
      1. New Minty domains don't need immediate integration to dapps to have value.
      2. Trading value will grow first, as MINT holders get & trade desirable domain names.
3. [DeFi](defi/defi-3.0.md) dapps: DEX, DAO emissions voting, onchain treasury, & treasury building "[Fetch Bonus](./#fetch-bonus)".

## **Roadmap Status**

**Live Now:**

1\. DEX & DeFi: Minty greatly expanded from a Solidly fork (Andre Cronje's DEX) on ETH.

&#x20;  A. Solidly DEX pools with low slippage. Get tokens ahead of APY start via [DeFi 3.0](defi/defi-3.0.md).

&#x20;  B. Novel price-increasing onchain treasury-building system with launch-time [Fetch Bonus](defi/fetch-bonus.md).

&#x20;  C. Team starts with 0 tokens. Can't dump or rug. Earns from token sales lock Fetch Bonus sales.

&#x20;  D. Earn from emissions voting & bribing. I.e. protocol wars.

&#x20;  E. Minty pools use the same safe & time tested Solidly audited code.

&#x20;  F. Concentrated APY at 14%/week emissions with 2%/week decay.

&#x20;  G. 15x Slower inflation than Bitcoin & Curve in the first 6 months.

**Short Term - Launch Targets in Oct, Nov & Dec 2022:**

2\. DEX Bets. Augur style bet options, but open to anyone & settled by DEX, Oct 2022

3\. NFT royalties via Harberger Tax. First collections scheduled for Nov 2022

3\. [Vitalik's ENS fix-proposal](https://twitter.com/vitalikbuterin/status/1568070721753989120): recurring demand-based fees to reduce domain squatting, Dec 2022

**Longer Term Roadmap** - after Dec 2022 (DAO can vote on priorities):

&#x20;  5\. Treasury voting & bribing. I.e., a much bigger protocol war.

&#x20;  6\. Launchpad with access to Minty's growing partners' user-base.

&#x20;  7\. Platform as a Service: provide Fetch & DAO treasury voting for other token projects.

&#x20;  8\. NFT Gamification - e.g. card games and more, for any NFT collection.

&#x20;  9\. Minty Worlds: protocol wars for game economies - vote with MINTS & earn 3rd party assets.

&#x20;  10\. Minty Chains: Minty Worlds can move treasuries to their own ZKR L2s, when available.

## Vitalik's ENS Fix Proposal

Minty will launch [Vitalik's proposal to fix ENS](https://twitter.com/vitalikbuterin/status/1568070721753989120) with recurring demand based pricing to reduce the damage done by purely negative-value domain squatters. Launch target by Nov 2022.

## 0xfoobar's NFT Royalties Fix

Minty will launch an NFT royalties fix that aligns artist incentive using [0xfoobar's popular Harberger Fees proposal](https://twitter.com/0xfoobar/status/1563614234390704129?s=20\&t=KQoDGfY9K5PIiihI3Vc2\_g) in a way that doesn't interrupt OS or SudoSwap, and can't be bypassed by wrapped NFTs, or in any way.  Launch target by Nov 2022.

## Need MINTS

MINTS will be need for ENS, NFTs, and all Minty dapps.

NFTS may be free for people holding enough MINTS. This can be e.g. a $200 value + $200 per referral for bounties, and will help advertise the system. First marketing round in Oct 2022.

## MINTS Utility & Supply

MINTS emissions are 15x slower inflation in the first 6 months than Bitcoin & Solidly (constant emissions model). Ie, Minty has a DEX like Curve, with low slippage stable pools.
