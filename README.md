**Executive Summary**: High APY stable pools on ETH on a Solidly fork with a novel price-increasing onchain treasury building system called Fetch Bonus. MINTS token earns from next evolution ENS, NFT & predictions dapps.

## DeFi 3.0

### High APY Stables Pools on ETH

Minty has low slippage stable pools using Solidly audited contracts.\
\
Total pools emissions will be 14% per week (decaying 2%/week). &#x20;

This is the same as 91,000% APY, compounded.\
\
Most of the emissions will go to pools with MINTS in them,

Still, high APY will be available to pools like USDC/USDT - stable pools.

This 14% weekly inflation is 15x slower than Bitcoin and Curve (constant emissions model, with some decay) by month 6. \
\
Whereas the constant emissions model inflates 180x from day 1 to day 180,\
\
MINTS only inflates about 12x in that time, or about 15x slower.

Minty also concentrates these APY emissions to only a few core pools so that typical users benefit from the high APY, and don't lose it via dispersion.

With that said, other pools can be voted for, like in Curve & Solidly
