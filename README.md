# MintyDAO Overview

## **Executive Summary**

MINTS token earns from next evolution ENS, NFT, DeFi 3.0 & other infrastructural dapps.

Vitalik's ENS fix-proposal is to pay recurring demand-based fees to reduce domain squatting.

NFT royalties problem: fees are being circumvented by SudoSwap AMM / NFT DEX pools.

NFT Solution: MINTS royalties via non-circumventable Harberger Tax - proposed by 0xfoobar.

For DeFi, Minty greatly expanded from a Solidly fork (Andre Cronje's DEX) on ETH.

MintyDAO adds a novel price-increasing onchain treasury building system called Fetch Bonus.&#x20;

High stable pools APY is available on Minty DEX & DeFi stack in USDC/USDT [Liquidity here](https://mintydao.io/liquidity)

These pools use the same Solidly audited code.
