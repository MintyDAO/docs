# MintyDAO

**Executive Summary**: High APY stable pools on ETH on a Solidly fork with a novel price-increasing onchain treasury building system called Fetch Bonus. MINTS token earns from next evolution ENS, NFT & predictions dapps.

## DeFi 3.0

### High APY Stables Pools on ETH

Minty has low slippage stable pools using Solidly audited contracts.\
\
Total pools emissions will be 14% per week (decaying 2%/week). &#x20;

This is the same as 91,000% APY, compounded.\
\
Most of the emissions will go to pools with MINTS in them.

Still, high APY will be available to pools like USDC/USDT - stable pools.

This 14% weekly inflation is 15x slower than Bitcoin and Curve (constant emissions model, with some decay) by month 6. \
\
The constant emissions model inflates 180x from day 1 to day 180.\
\
By contrast, MINTS only inflates about 12x in that time, or about 15x slower.

Minty also concentrates these APY emissions to only a few core pools so that typical users benefit from the high APY, and don't lose it via dispersion.

With that said, other pools can be voted for, as in the famed Curve & Convex "protocol wars"

### Voting on Pools Emissions Gauges

Like in Curve & Convex, users can vote and earn bribes by voting where 40% of the 14% weekly emissions APY will go.\
\
Every 1 MINTS of emissions requires Voting Power for 10 MINTS locked for 4 years.\
\
This way, APY spreading to other pools also benefits MINTS holders.

Minty has both voting & bribing, so, like Solidly, it combines Curve & Convex.

It also enables voting on treasury itself.\
\
MintyDAO therefore goes much father than Solidly, which doesn't even have treasury, let alone onchain contract-controlled via vote & bribe treasury, which gives further value to MINTS.
