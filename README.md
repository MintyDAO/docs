# MintyDAO Overview

## **Executive Summary**

MINTS token earns from these next evolution ENS, NFT, DeFi 3.0 & other infrastructural dapps:

1\. Vitalik's ENS fix-proposal is to pay recurring demand-based fees to reduce domain squatting.

&#x20; B. High stable pools APY is available on Minty DEX & DeFi stack in USDC/USDT [Liquidity here](https://mintydao.io/liquidity)

&#x20; C. These pools use the same Solidly audited code.

4\. DEX & NFT bets. Augur style bet options, but settled by DEX & oracles.

5\. Launchpad & Platform as a Service
