# MintyDAO Overview

## **Executive Summary**

MINTS token earns from these next evolution ENS, NFT, DeFi 3.0 & other infrastructural dapps:

**Live Now:**

1\. DEX & DeFi: Minty greatly expanded from a Solidly fork (Andre Cronje's DEX) on ETH.

&#x20; A. High stable pools APY with low slippage. Learn how to earn in [DeFi 3.0](defi/defi-3.0.md)

&#x20; B. Novel price-increasing onchain treasury-building system with launch-time [Fetch Bonus](defi/fetch-bonus.md).

&#x20; C. Team starts with 0 tokens. Can't dump or rug. Earns from token sales lock Fetch Bonus sales.

&#x20; D. Earn from emissions voting & bribing. I.e. protocol wars.

&#x20; E. Minty pools use the same safe & time tested Solidly audited code.

&#x20; F. 228% and 768% APY in USDT/USDC and MINTS/ETH pools (40% or 14%/week emissions)

&#x20; G. 15x Slower inflation than Bitcoin & Curve in the first 6 months.

2\. DEX Bets. Augur style bet options, but open to anyone & settled by DEX.

**Short Term - Target Launch by Nov 2022:**

3\. Vitalik's ENS fix-proposal is to pay recurring demand-based fees to reduce domain squatting.

4\. NFT royalties problem: fees are being circumvented by SudoSwap AMM / NFT DEX pools.

&#x20; NFT solution: MINTS royalties via non-circumventable Harberger Tax - proposed by 0xfoobar.

**Longer Term Roadmap** - after Nov 2022 (DAO can vote on priorities):

5\. Treasury voting & bribing. I.e., a much bigger protocol war.

6\. Launchpad with access to Minty's growing partners' user-base.

7\. Platform as a Service: provide Fetch & DAO treasury voting for other token projects.

8\. NFT Gamification - e.g. card games and more, for any NFT collection.

9\. Minty Worlds: protocol wars for game economies - vote with MINTS & earn 3rd party assets.

10\. Minty Chains: Minty Worlds can move treasuries to their own ZKR L2s, when available.
