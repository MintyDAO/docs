# DEX & NFT Bets

Augur style bets can be created by anyone.\
\
Unlike Augur, no complex consensus is needed to resolve bets.\
\
DEX is now used as the truth for ERC20 bets.&#x20;

E.g., "Will ETH flip BTC by Dec 2023" can be bet, with any payout token (ETH, WBTC, USDC, etc).

Bets can be entered or exited at any time, with profits & losses according to any ratio changes in the Yes vs No ratio.

By the ending date, Yes takes the No pool if the condition proved true, and vice-versa otherwise.

The bet creator earns 1% of bet liquidity.

MINTS tokens are bought with another 1%.&#x20;

SudoSwap can soon be integrated for NFT bets via its DEX.
