# DEX Bets

Augur style bets can be created by anyone.\
\
Unlike Augur, no complex consensus is needed to resolve bets.\
\
DEX is used as the truth.

E.g., "Will ETH flip BTC by Dec 2023" can be bet, with any payout token (ETH, WBTC, USDC, etc).

Bets can be entered or exited at any time, with profits & losses according to any ratio changes in the Yes vs No ratio.

By the ending date, Yes takes the No pool if the condition proved true, and vice-versa otherwise.

The bet creator earns 1% of bet liquidity.

MINTS tokens are bought with another 1%.&#x20;
