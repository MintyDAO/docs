# MINTS emissions voting

Like in Curve & Convex, users can vote and earn bribes by voting where 40% of the 14% weekly emissions APY will go.\
\
Every 1 MINTS of emissions requires Voting Power for 10 MINTS locked for 4 years.\
\
This way, APY spreading to other pools also benefits MINTS holders.

Minty has both voting & bribing, so, like Solidly, it combines Curve & Convex.

It also enables voting on treasury itself.\
\
MintyDAO therefore goes much father than Solidly, which doesn't even have treasury, let alone onchain contract-controlled via vote & bribe treasury, which gives further value to MINTS.
