# NFT Royalties

Problem: NFT market suffers from alignment incentives issues

Exchanges like SudoSwap removed royalties from artists

This is seen as a major incentives alignment issue, especially for ongoing project dev

Transfer fees can’t be injected without breaking decentralizaiton and standards

High volumes previously also didn’t mean collectors benefitted, when floor prices were low

Solution: A twist on the Harberger Tax

Harberger Tax is a popular proposal to replace lose volume earnings The Variable substack

Revenue from the tax can be shared by collectors, so volume, not only price, helps them.

Holders evaluate their property (NFT), and pay Harberger Tax based on that.

If the value is low, holders risk anyone buying it from them at that price at any time.

If the value is too high, the tax they pay is higher at e.g. 10-20% per year.

It’s said Harberger Tax is difficult to make simple, but MintyDAO made it 1 click simple.

Status: launching by Oct 2022
