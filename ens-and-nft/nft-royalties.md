# Royalties

As [0xfoobar](https://twitter.com/0xfoobar/status/1563614234390704129?s=20\&t=KQoDGfY9K5PIiihI3Vc2\_g) explained in his NFT royalties problem and solution blog tweet:

### Problem

NFT market suffers from alignment incentives issues.

Exchanges like SudoSwap removed royalties from artists.

This is seen as a major incentives alignment issue, especially for ongoing project dev.

Transfer fees can’t be injected without breaking decentralizaiton and standards.

High volumes previously also didn’t mean collectors benefitted, when floor prices were low.

### Solution

Harberger Tax

Harberger Tax is a popular proposal to replace lose volume earnings The Variable substack

Revenue from the tax can be shared by collectors, so volume, not only price, helps them.

Holders evaluate their property (NFT), and pay Harberger Tax based on that.

If the value is low, holders risk anyone buying it from them at that price at any time.

If the value is too high, the tax they pay is higher at e.g. 10-20% per year.

It’s said Harberger Tax is difficult to make simple, but MintyDAO made it 1 click simple.

Launch target: by November 2022
