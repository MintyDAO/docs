# Vitalik's ENS Fix-Proposal

As [Vitalik implied](https://twitter.com/vitalikbuterin/status/1568070721753989120), ENS is somewhat broken in that it sold its most valuable domains to squatters without any recurring demand based prices.&#x20;

Squatters provide much negative value and often make key domain names unused & inaccessible, while large windfalls squatters earn isnâ€™t a very useful market game.

Vitalik recommends recurring demand based pricing for domain names (e.g. pay 0.5% tax from the purchase price, yearly).&#x20;

The proposal is less aggressive than the Harberger Tax;&#x20;

The proposal dampens the tax a holder pays after rejecting a high bid and gives 4 weeks for the holder to accept or reject.&#x20;

If accepted, the new holder pays 0.5% from the price paid. If the holders reject, they pay some capped or dampened amount from this 0.5%.

MintyDAO proposes 1/10 dampening, so instead of 0.5%, just 0.05%.&#x20;

If a $100M bid is rejected, the current rejecting holder pays 0.05%, or $50K/year to continue renting the domain.&#x20;

If the bid is accepted, the new holder of the $100M domain buyer pays $500K/year to MintyDAO.&#x20;

MintyDAO plan to have such decentralized domains available by November 2022.&#x20;

Over 75% of revenues goes to MINTS pools, burning, and veNFT lockers.&#x20;

DAO voters can pair MINTS pools with public goods & other project tokens.&#x20;

Sub-domain holders can earn recurring royalties, as well, and again, over 85% goes to MINTS pools, burning, and holders.
